Binary Search Tree (BST) Program

This C program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) using an array representation. It provides functionalities to create a BST from an array, delete nodes, and print the height, level, and height of any node in the BST.
Features

    Create a BST from an array.
    Delete any node from the BST.
    Print the height of the BST.
    Print the level and height of any node in the BST.

Usage

    Creating a BST from an array:

    To create a BST from an array, simply provide the array of integers representing the BST elements as input.

    Deleting a node:

    To delete a node from the BST, specify the value of the node to be deleted.

    Printing the height of the BST:

    The program provides a function to print the height of the BST.

    Printing the level and height of any node:

    You can print the level and height of any node in the BST by specifying the value of the node.

How to Run

    Compile the program using a C compiler. For example:

gcc -o Assignment2 bstassignmenonet.c

Run the compiled program:

bash

    ./Assignment2

Example

Consider the following array representation of a BST:

30
20
40
10
25
35

Output:

bash

Inorder traversal of the BST: 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 
BST after deleting 25: 5 10 15 20 30 35 40 45 
Height of the BST: 4
Level of 15: 4
Height of 15: 1
